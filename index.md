# Quizzinator9000 Project Overview

Welcome to the Quizzinator9000 project page!

## Vision statement

<!-- Vision statement draft -->
<!-- Currently, questions are to be generated by developers. Possible future versions of the app may have the ability to include a different user level (instructor) with the ability to open a course, create questions relevant to that subject and grant access to specific students. -->

<!--## Summary sentence-->

The Quizzinator9000 is a means for anyone to test and reinforce their knowledge of included topics at any time and in any place.

<!-- ## Project Description -->
Our application is a self-contained quiz/study tool that enables students to deepen and confirm their knowledge of a given topic through quizzes of course topics.
<!--removed "generated from an on-board question bank"-->

<!-- ## Target Audience -->
This app is designed to be used by students to confirm their learning of available course topics in the app. The app has questions relevant to the chosen subject material in a question bank used to generate a quiz from randomly selected questions. The students can then take quizzes any time they are available to study and get their quiz results instantly. <!--Students can access all quizzes through access controls included in the app.-->

Students will be able to review their quiz result history and select quizzes from different topics within a given course. They will also be able to take quizzes multiple times to continually improve and test their knowledge. Every time they take a quiz, it will look slightly different from their previous quizzes so that the learner will always be challenged.

Course material will be divided into sections, so students can take quizzes on specific sections of course material or take a quiz on the whole course. <!--Future iterations could expand to include different question types and more comprehensive aggregate data for scores on a given question, section or topic.-->

<!-- ## Value of Project -->
Our project will improve on current education and study tools by letting students review subject material through quizzes any time instead of having an instructor create and grade the quizzes themselves. <!--Further, our system will ideally extend to include a persistent database of questions that can improve and expand over time.-->

<!-- ## Success Criteria -->
The project will be considered successful if at least 80% of users polled by survey report they prefer this app over other forms of _any-time practice testing_, and 80% also claim to have improved their comfort level with their given subject matter. Also, if less than 10% of users report functionality issues when using the app.

## Intended Users

The Quizzinator9000 is intended to be used by anyone looking to broaden their knowledge on the subjects available in the app. The app is completely self contained and doesn't require outside resourses. That way, users of the Quizzinator9000 can take quizzes any time and in any place regardless of connectivity.

## Functionality

The Quizzinator9000 has three main areas of functionality:

* [Selecting a Quiz](#selecting-a-quiz)
* [Taking the Quiz](#taking-a-quiz)
* [Reviewing your Quiz result history](#reviewing-your-results)

### Selecting a Quiz

<!-- ![starting a quiz](media/starting_quiz.mp4) -->

>From the Quiz Selection view, a user can move through the Subjects, related topics and sub-topics(Quizzes) available on the app and select the Quiz they would like to take. From that selection a quiz will be generated from the question bank by randomly selecting from available questions pertaining to their selected sub-topic.

### Taking a Quiz

<!-- ![taking a quiz](media/taking_quiz.mp4) -->

>From the Take Quiz view, a user can move through the questions in their quiz and select their answer from the presented options. If the timer expires, their quiz is over and any unanswered questions are marked as incorrect. Once completed, the user can navigate back through their questinos to review any errors they have made.

### Reviewing your Results

<!-- ![view scores](media/view_scores.mp4) -->

>From the Quiz History view, a user can review their history of average quiz scores by Subject, topic or sub-topic. They can also see all their quiz scores for a selected sub-topic.

## Retrospective

### Project Postmortem

#### How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted?

There were three features we came up with during iteration 0 that we did not end up implementing:

1. Different student accounts – Which we did not end up implementing because we did not think it was necessary for our project. All the data for our project is stored locally on the users’ device and the functionality of the app is the same for all users, so having different accounts didn’t seem like it would benefit users in any way. We also did not think we would have time to implement any features that would be able to make use of different student accounts within our three iterations, so we decided not to implement this feature.

2. Create notes – We originally thought of adding the ability for users to write their own notes within the app. We decided not to implement this because we did not think it would fit very well with the rest of our app. We instead focused on improving and adding quiz related features, since the main focus of our app was to be a quiz app.

3. Review Previous Quiz Answers – This is a feature we would still like to have implemented. However, we decided to leave it out because we did not think we would have the time to implement it within the 3 iterations of our project.

We added a couple more features to replace some of the ones we removed. We added “Navigation Improvements” and “Customizable Quiz Options” since we thought they would be better additions to our project and fit better with our vision.

### Retrospective Activity

#### Deadlines

We have not been as successful with getting all our features/user stories/issues done on time as we would have liked. In both iteration 1 and 2 there was at least one feature that we did not finish and had to push to a later iteration.

To improve this, we will try to get each of our assigned tasks done well before the deadline so that even if we have problems with any of them, we will have lots of time to fix them. Since part of the reason we didn’t get everything completed in previous iterations was because we ran into problems right before the deadline. If we are able to get all our features/user stores/issues implemented before the deadline for this iteration, then we will consider that a success.

#### The database

A problem we encountered while making this project was the database implementation. It was so completely new to us that we decided to leave it for last. In hindsight, we should have definitely started with doing the higher priority developer tasks like making the database, because we did not have it finished by iteration 2. We all realized that something will go wrong when working with new tools. We had a lot of syntax issues in our database script and missing a dependency injection in our gradle build. If we did this earlier, we could have asked our instructor earlier to solve issue and hopefully finish by the iteration deadline. In the future, we would definitely be more interactive with the instructors with regards to questions and problems that arise during our project.

## Contributors/team members

include a description of any specific special development skills that each team member gained

### Troy Thomas

> "Things I learned from this project: How to use Git, how to use Android Studio, how to make activities & layouts for android applications, how to structure a project well, and how to work better with a team and coordinate tasks."

### Luc Miron

> "I learned how to use the android studio development platform and the tools in GitLab. I improved my teamwork skills and was able to work with many different types of people."

### Gabriel Zacci Coloma

> "I learned that working in groups and making projects requires a ton of teamwork and picking each other up where we fall short on. It is important to implement the high priority tasks and features early in order to weed out the mistakes that would otherwise be too late when left for last. I definitely can say that I enjoy working in groups and I improved in working as a group after iteration 2."
